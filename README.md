Welcome to the magical tavern! Travelers and adventurers from far and wide gather here to discuss their next adventure or simply just meet over a good ol' pint of beer

## Okay so, what is this *really*?

magicaltavern is a Discord Bot written in python with the pycord-API-wrapper that aims to organise D&D/PnP Discord Servers.

There isn't anything here *yet*, but that's only because development has just started.

## What is it gonna do?

The magicaltavern bot is supposed to:

- Help Dungeon Masters find players for their campaign, by letting them 'advertise' their campaign through some sort of lobby. If a player likes the campaign, they can enter it. There are only so many slots in one campaign (configurable by the DM for each individual campaign), and slots are given out by the first-come-first-served-principle.
  - Once a campaign has reached the amount of required players, the bot will create role(s) and channels for this campaign, so that players have a centralised place to ask the DM questions or just talk to each other about the campaign without cluttering up the main chats.

Note, that this README.md will not always be updated the instant I have/receive a new idea, but please feel free to suggest features in the Issues tab.
